This repository contains two workflows that I have found useful for personal creative writing. These workflows are intended to utilise eInk digital notebooks as an editing and revising medium, while keep the core document in markdown.

## Proofreading Markups to Markdown

In practice, I have found that the hardest part of writing on the computer has been revising my work, especially with more creative goals that may require a lot of rearrangement or the complete elimination of some sections. However,
when I hit on the idea of exporting the markdown writing to a pdf and then loading that on my digital notebook (a Boox 4c Air), I had a lot more success with making measurable progress towards completing stories. However, this produced
a new issue about porting the editing work I had done back to markdown, especially as the pdf started to get cluttered with hand notes. 

The issue is entirely one of tedium, which introduces a lot of chances for mistakes to creep in. So what this workflow does is utilize multi-modal AI to detect and categorize the handwritten proofreading marks and to then apply them on
top of the original markdown document, automating the transcription process and allowing the focus to stay in the crreative realm.

# Markdown to PDF Export

TODO: Separate script for exporting the original markdown document to the pdf I can load on my digital notebook
